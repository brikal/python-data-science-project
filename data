## How data was processed

Dataset: Yahoo Finance (Stock) + Macrotrends (Revenue)

1. Stock data: downloaded via `yfinance`. Date parsed and set as index; numeric columns ensured. Missing values checked and dropped if insignificant. Stock close price resampled to quarter-end for comparison with revenue.

2. Revenue data: scraped from Macrotrends using `pandas.read_html` (URL in Sources). Revenue strings cleaned by removing currency symbols and commas, converted to float.

3. Merge logic: stock close price at quarter-end was matched with revenue for that quarter. Merging was done by aligning dates on quarter end (inner join). Details are in the notebook cells titled "Merge stock and revenue".
